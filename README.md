  ## Usage 
  Follow these instructions to use the application properly:
  Clone the project to your machine.  After cloning, open up the repository using a text-editor like `VS Code`.  Afterwards, open up the command line and type `npm install` to install the necessary packages for `express` and `mongoose`, as they'll be used in the repo also.
